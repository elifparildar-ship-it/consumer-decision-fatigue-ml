# Consumer Decision Fatigue — Exploratory Machine Learning Analysis

## Overview
This project provides an exploratory machine learning analysis of an experimental consumer psychology study on decision fatigue.

Using a multiclass logistic regression model, the analysis examines whether experimental conditions can be predicted from decision fatigue, satisfaction, purchase intention, and decision time measures.

## Data
The analysis is based on anonymized experimental survey data.

Due to ethical considerations and participant privacy, the raw dataset is not publicly shared. The notebook documents the expected data structure and modeling steps.

## Methods
- Multiclass logistic regression
- Train–test split with stratification
- Dummy classifier baseline comparison
- Cross-validation for model stability
- Feature standardization and coefficient-based interpretation

## Purpose
This notebook is intended as a methodological complement to the main experimental analysis conducted in R, demonstrating predictive modeling and machine learning workflows in Python.
